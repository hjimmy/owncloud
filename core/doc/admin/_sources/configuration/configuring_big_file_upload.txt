Dealing with Big File Uploads
=============================

It's useful to know limiting factors, that make it impossible to exceed the values given by the ownCloud-system:

.. note:: The ownCloud sync client is not affected by this described upload limits
   as it is uploading files in smaller chunks.

Not outnumberable upload limits:
--------------------------------
* < 2GB on 32Bit OS-architecture
* < 2GB with Server Version 4.5 or older
* < 2GB on Windows (32Bit and 64Bit)
* < 2GB with IE6 - IE8
* < 4GB with IE9 - IE10

Other recommendable preconditions:
----------------------------------

* Make sure, that the latest version of PHP (at least 5.4.9) is installed
* Disable user quota. This means: set the user quota of the account, you are currently logged in, to "unlimited". This is important, because you possibly could not watch otherwise, whether the desired changes take effect.

Enabling uploading big files
----------------------------

.. note:: The order of the following steps is important! If you swap steps described below, the settings may fail.

**Go to the admin section in the ownCloud-WebUI and do the following:**

* Under "File handling" set the Maximum upload size to the desired value (e.g. 16GB)
* Click the "save"-Button

.. note:: This input box is only shown if your webserver has write access to your
   ``.htaccess`` file and the ``AllowOverride ALL`` directive is set in your
   webservers vhost configuration. It is also not shown on non-Apache webservers.

**Configuring your webserver**

ownCloud comes with a .htaccess - file which propagates all config to your webserver. To adapt those settings go to the ownCloud - Folder on your server and set the following two parameters inside the .htaccess file:

* ``upload_max_filesize = 16G``   (e.g., to stay consistent with the example value above)
* ``post_max_size = 16G``   (e.g., to stay consistent with the example value above)

If you don't want to use the shipped .htaccess - file, outcomment those options there and edit them in your global php.ini file:

* Under Debian or SUSE and their derivatives this file resides at ``/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini``
* On Windows, you can find this file within ``C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\PHP.ini``

Set the following two parameters inside the php.ini to the same value as chosen inside the admin-section one step before:

* ``upload_max_filesize = 16G``   (e.g., to stay consistent with the example value above)
* ``post_max_size = 16G``   (e.g., to stay consistent with the example value above)

**Output Buffering** must be turned off in ``.htaccess`` or ``php.ini``, or PHP will return memory-related errors.

* ``output_buffering = 0``

**These client configurations have been proven by testing maximum file sizes of 16 GB:**

* Linux 32 Bit: Ubuntu, Firefox => 16GB 
* Windows 8  64 Bit: Google Chrome => 8GB

**Note:**
You will need a minimum of 16GB (e.g, to stay consistent with the example value above), in your upload_tmp_dir. 
Normally this points to /tmp. If your /tmp has not enough space, 
you can change the value of upload_tmp_dir in your php.ini

The `mod_reqtimeout <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_reqtimeout.html>`_
Apache module could also stop large uploads from completing. If you're using this
module and getting failed uploads of large files either disable it in your Apache
config or raise the configured ``RequestReadTimeout`` timeouts.

There are also several other configuration option in your webserver config which
could prevent the upload of larger files. Please see the manual of your webserver
how to configure those values correctly:

Apache
~~~~~~
* `LimitRequestBody <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody>`_
* `SSLRenegBufferSize <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslrenegbuffersize>`_

Apache with mod_fcgid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `FcgidMaxRequestLen <https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html#fcgidmaxrequestlen>`_

NginX
~~~~~
* `client_max_body_size <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size>`_

IIS
~~~
* `maxAllowedContentLength <http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering/requestlimits#005>`_
