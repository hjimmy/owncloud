Patches:

- Sabre: replaced fpassthru due to large file issues (https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/8578#issuecomment-49812124)
- remove dompdf from phpdocx, because we already ship dompdf in the 3rdparty's root folder (see 3ae4904 and e1e3207)
- some external entity patches from https://github.com/owncloud/3rdparty/pull/74 - they should get superseeded by updating the affected libraries.
